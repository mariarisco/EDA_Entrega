"Automated Monitoring of Deforestation in Ucayali Using LandTrendr: Patterns, Challenges, and Conservation Applications."

Deforestation Issue: Over 65% of Ucayali's forest, nearly 100,000 hectares, was lost between 2001-2021, reflecting Amazon-wide deforestation trends driven by agriculture and livestock.

LandTrendr's Role: LandTrendr uses Landsat data to monitor vegetation and analyse deforestation events through spectral metrics like magnitude, rate, and year of change.

Deforestation Patterns: Deforested areas show higher magnitude, rate, and DSNR values, but data dispersion and overlap complicate clear classification.

Improving Models: Enhancing deforestation models requires addressing data dispersion, using transformations, incorporating diverse datasets, and mitigating multicollinearity.

Research Significance: LandTrendr supports automated forest monitoring, crucial for conservation, climate mitigation, and initiatives like REDD+ and carbon farming.
